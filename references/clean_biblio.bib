  abstract = {The wide adoption of Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs in applications where decision-making under uncertainty is fundamental, has brought a great deal of attention to the ability of these models to accurately quantify the uncertainty in their predictions. Previous work on combining CNNs with Gaussian processes GPs has been developed under the assumption that the predictive probabilities of these models are well-calibrated. In this paper we show that, in fact, current combinations of CNNs and GPs are miscalibrated.  We proposes a novel combination that considerably outperforms previous approaches on this aspect, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on image classification tasks.}

  abstract = {{Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) provide a Bayesian non-parametric alternative
to standard parametric deep learning models. A DGP is formed by stacking
multiple GPs resulting in a well-regularized composition of functions. The
Bayesian framework that equips the model with attractive properties, such as
implicit capacity control and predictive uncertainty, makes it at the same time
challenging to combine with a convolutional structure. This has hindered the
application of DGPs in computer vision tasks, an area where deep parametric
models (i.e. CNNs) have made breakthroughs. Standard kernels used in DGPs such
as radial basis functions (RBFs) are insufficient for handling pixel
variability in raw images. In this paper, we build on the recent convolutional
GP to develop Convolutional DGP (CDGP) models which effectively capture image
level features through the use of convolution kernels, therefore opening up the
way for applying DGPs to computer vision tasks. Our model learns local spatial
influence and outperforms strong GP based baselines on multi-class image
classification. We also consider various constructions of convolution kernel
over the image patches, analyze the computational trade-offs and provide an
efficient framework for convolutional DGP models. The experimental results on
image data such as MNIST, rectangles-image, CIFAR10 and Caltech101 demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.}},

Techniques based on gradient matching, which aim to minimize the discrepancy between the slope of a data interpolant and the derivatives predicted from the differential equations, offer a computationally appealing shortcut to the inference problem. The present paper discusses a method based on nonparametric Bayesian statistics with Gaussian processes due to Calderhead et al. (2008), and shows how inference in this model can be substantially improved by consistently sampling from the joint distribution of the ODE parameters and GP hyperparameters. We demonstrate the efficiency of our adaptive gradient matching technique on three benchmark systems, and perform a detailed comparison with the method in Calderhead et al.

efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling

data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary
objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The
hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little
tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are
discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the
algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable
to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework.
Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares
favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax,
a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.}},

  abstract = {{For optimal decision making under variable class distributions and misclassification costs a classifier needs to produce well-calibrated estimates of the posterior probability. Isotonic calibration is a powerful non-parametric method that is however prone to overfitting on smaller datasets; hence a parametric method based on the logistic curve is commonly used. While logistic calibration is designed for normally distributed per-class scores, we demonstrate experimentally that many classifiers including Naive Bayes and Adaboost suffer from a particular distortion where these score distributions are heavily skewed. In such cases logistic calibration can easily yield probability estimates that are worse than the original scores. Moreover, the logistic curve family does not include the identity function, and hence logistic calibration can easily uncalibrate a perfectly calibrated classifier. In this paper we solve all these problems with a richer class of calibration maps based on the beta distribution. We derive the method from first principles and show that fitting it is as easy as fitting a logistic curve. Extensive experiments show that beta calibration is superior to logistic calibration for Naive Bayes and Adaboost.}},

@incollection{Flach16,
  abstract = {{Classifier calibration is concerned with the scale on which a classifier's scores are expressed. While a classifier ultimately maps instances to discrete classes, it is often beneficial to decompose this mapping into a scoring classifier which outputs one or more real-valued numbers and a decision rule which converts these numbers into predicted classes. For example, a linear classifier might output a positive or negative score whose magnitude is proportional to the distance between the instance and the decision boundary, in which case the decision rule would be a simple threshold on that score. The advantage of calibrating these scores to a known, domain-independent scale is that the decision rule then also takes a domain-independent form and does not have to be learned. The best-known example of this occurs when the classifier's scores approximate, in a precise sense, the posterior probability over the classes; the main advantage of this is that the optimal decision rule is to predict the class that minimizes expected cost averaged over all possible true classes.The main methods to obtain calibrated scores are logistic calibration, which is a parametric method that assumes that the distances on either side of the decision boundary are normally distributed and a nonparametric alternative that is variously known as isotonic regression, the pool adjacent violators (PAV) method or the ROC convex hull (ROCCH) method.}},

In this context, the capabilities of statistical machine learning methods is limited by the computing time rather than the sample size. A more precise analysis uncovers qualitatively different tradeoffs for the case of small-scale and large-scale learning problems. The large-scale case involves the computational complexity of the underlying optimization algorithm in non-trivial ways. Unlikely optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent show amazing performance for large-scale problems. In particular, second order stochastic gradient and averaged stochastic gradient are asymptotically efficient after a single pass on the training set.}},

Researchers worldwide are analyzing the model output and will produce results likely to underlie the forthcoming Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Unprecedented in scale and attracting interest from all major climate modeling groups, CMIP5 includes  ‚Äù long term‚Äù simulations of twentieth-century climate and projections for the twenty-first century and beyond. Conventional atmosphere‚Äìocean global climate models and Earth system models of intermediate complexity are for the first time being joined by more recently developed Earth system models under an experiment design that allows both types of models to be compared to observations on an equal footing. Besides the longterm experiments, CMIP5 calls for an entirely new suite of  ‚Äù near term‚Äù simulations focusing on recent decades and the future to year 2035. These  ‚Äù decadal predictions‚Äù are initialized based on observations and will be used to explore the predictability of climate and to assess the forecast system's predictive skill. The CMIP5 experiment design also allows for participation of stand-alone atmospheric models and includes a variety of idealized experiments that will improve understanding of the range of model responses found in the more complex and realistic simulations. An exceptionally comprehensive set of model output is being collected and made freely available to researchers through an integrated but distributed data archive. For researchers unfamiliar with climate models, the limitations of the models and experiment design are described.}},

  abstract = {{Many architects believe that major improvements in cost-energy-performance
must now come from domain-specific hardware. This paper evaluates a custom
ASIC---called a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)---deployed in datacenters since
2015 that accelerates the inference phase of neural networks (NN). The heart of
the TPU is a 65,536 8-bit MAC matrix multiply unit that offers a peak
throughput of 92 TeraOps/second (TOPS) and a large (28 MiB) software-managed
on-chip memory. The TPU's deterministic execution model is a better match to
the 99th-percentile response-time requirement of our NN applications than are
the time-varying optimizations of CPUs and GPUs (caches, out-of-order
execution, multithreading, multiprocessing, prefetching, ...) that help average
throughput more than guaranteed latency. The lack of such features helps
explain why, despite having myriad MACs and a big memory, the TPU is relatively
small and low power. We compare the TPU to a server-class Intel Haswell CPU and
an Nvidia K80 GPU, which are contemporaries deployed in the same datacenters.
Our workload, written in the high-level TensorFlow framework, uses production
NN applications (MLPs, CNNs, and LSTMs) that represent 95\% of our datacenters'
NN inference demand. Despite low utilization for some applications, the TPU is
on average about 15X - 30X faster than its contemporary GPU or CPU, with
TOPS/Watt about 30X - 80X higher. Moreover, using the GPU's GDDR5 memory in the
TPU would triple achieved TOPS and raise TOPS/Watt to nearly 70X the GPU and
200X the CPU.}},

In a preliminary smoothing step, the time series data are interpolated; then, in a second step, the parameters of the ODEs are optimised so as to minimise some metric measuring the difference between the slopes of the tangents to the interpolants, and the time derivatives from the ODEs. In this way, the ODEs never have to be solved explicitly. This review provides a concise methodological overview of the current state-of-the-art methods for gradient matching in ODEs, followed by an empirical comparative evaluation based on a set of widely used and representative benchmark data.}},

  abstract = {{Inference in mechanistic models of non-linear differential equations is a challenging problem in current computational statistics. Due to the high computational costs of numerically solving the differential equations in every step of an iterative parameter adaptation scheme, approximate methods based on gradient matching have become popular. However, these methods critically depend on the smoothing scheme for function interpolation. The present article adapts an idea from manifold learning and demonstrates that a time warping approach aiming to homogenize intrinsic length scales can lead to a significant improvement in parameter estimation accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme on noisy data from two dynamical systems with periodic limit cycle, a biopathway, and an application from soft-tissue mechanics. Our study also provides a comparative evaluation on a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios.}},

  abstract = {{Parameter inference in mechanistic models based on non-affine differential equations is computationally onerous, and various faster alternatives based on gradient matching have been proposed. A particularly promising approach is based on nonparametric Bayesian modelling with Gaussian processes, which exploits the fact that a Gaussian process is closed under differentiation. However, two alternative paradigms have been proposed. The first paradigm, proposed at NIPS 2008 and AISTATS 2013, is based on a product of experts approach and a marginalization over the derivatives of the state variables. The second paradigm, proposed at ICML 2014, is based on a probabilistic generative model and a marginalization over the state variables. The claim has been made that this leads to better inference results. In the present article, we offer a new interpretation of the second paradigm, which highlights the underlying assumptions, approximations and limitations. In particular, we show that the second paradigm suffers from an intrinsic identifiability problem, which the first paradigm is not affected by.}},

Current methods for estimating parameters in differential equations from noisy data are computationally intensive and often poorly suited to the realization of statistical objectives such as inference and interval estimation. The paper describes a new method that uses noisy measurements on a subset of variables to estimate the parameters defining a system of non-linear differential equations. The approach is based on a modification of data smoothing methods along with a generalization of profiled estimation. We derive estimates and confidence intervals, and show that these have low bias and good coverage properties respectively for data that are simulated from models in chemical engineering and neurobiology. The performance of the method is demonstrated by using real world data from chemistry and from the progress of the autoimmune disease lupus. Copyright 2007 Royal Statistical Society.}},

  abstract = {{Differential equations are used in modeling diverse system behaviors in a wide variety of sciences. Methods for estimating the differential equation parameters traditionally depend on the inclusion of initial system states and numerically solving the equations. This paper presents Smooth Functional Tempering, a new population Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach for posterior estimation of parameters. The proposed method borrows insights from parallel tempering and model based smoothing to define a sequence of approximations to the posterior. The tempered approximations depend on relaxations of the solution to the differential equation model, reducing the need for estimating the initial system states and obtaining a numerical differential equation solution. Rather than tempering via approximations to the posterior that are more heavily rooted in the prior, this new method tempers towards data features. Using our proposed approach, we observed faster convergence and robustness to both initial values and prior distributions that do not reflect the features of the data. Two variations of the method are proposed and their performance is examined through simulation studies and a real application to the chemical reaction dynamics of producing nylon.}},

Such uncertainties, arising from the loss of precision induced by numerical calculation with limited time or hardware, are important for much contemporary science and industry. Within applications such as climate science and astrophysics, the need to make decisions on the basis of computations with large and complex data have led to a renewed focus on the management of numerical uncertainty. We describe how several seminal classic numerical methods can be interpreted naturally as probabilistic inference. We then show that the probabilistic view suggests new algorithms that can flexibly be adapted to suit application specifics, while delivering improved empirical performance. We provide concrete illustrations of the benefits of probabilistic numeric algorithms on real scientific problems from astrometry and astronomical imaging, while highlighting open problems with these new algorithms. Finally, we describe how probabilistic numerical methods provide a coherent framework for identifying the uncertainty in calculations performed with a combination of numerical algorithms (e.g. both numerical optimizers and differential equation solvers), potentially allowing the diagnosis (and control) of error sources in computations.}},

of the art classifiers on many tasks. However, they often do not capture their
own uncertainties well making them less robust in the real world as they
overconfidently extrapolate and do not notice domain shift. Gaussian processes
(GPs) with RBF kernels on the other hand have better calibrated uncertainties
and do not overconfidently extrapolate far from data in their training set.
However, GPs have poor representational power and do not perform as well as
DNNs on complex domains. In this paper we show that GP hybrid deep networks,
GPDNNs, (GPs on top of DNNs and trained end-to-end) inherit the nice properties
of both GPs and DNNs and are much more robust to adversarial examples. When
extrapolating to adversarial examples and testing in domain shift settings,
GPDNNs frequently output high entropy class probabilities corresponding to
essentially "don't know". GPDNNs are therefore promising as deep architectures
that know when they don't know.}},

  abstract = {{We introduce scalable deep kernels, which combine the structural properties of deep learning architectures with the non-parametric flexibility of kernel methods. Specifically, we transform the inputs of a spectral mixture base kernel with a deep architecture, using local kernel interpolation, inducing points, and structure exploiting (Kronecker and Toeplitz) algebra for a scalable kernel representation. These closed-form kernels can be used as drop-in replacements for standard kernels, with benefits in expressive power and scalability. We jointly learn the properties of these kernels through the marginal likelihood of a Gaussian process. Inference and learning cost O(n) for n training points, and predictions cost O(1) per test point. On a large and diverse collection of applications, including a dataset with 2 million examples, we show improved performance over scalable Gaussian processes with flexible kernel learning models, and stand-alone deep architectures.}},

@misc{Kurakin17,
  abstract = {{Most existing machine learning classifiers are highly vulnerable to
adversarial examples. An adversarial example is a sample of input data which
has been modified very slightly in a way that is intended to cause a machine
learning classifier to misclassify it. In many cases, these modifications can
be so subtle that a human observer does not even notice the modification at
all, yet the classifier still makes a mistake. Adversarial examples pose
security concerns because they could be used to perform an attack on machine
learning systems, even if the adversary has no access to the underlying model.
Up to now, all previous work have assumed a threat model in which the adversary
can feed data directly into the machine learning classifier. This is not always
the case for systems operating in the physical world, for example those which
are using signals from cameras and other sensors as an input. This paper shows
that even in such physical world scenarios, machine learning systems are
vulnerable to adversarial examples. We demonstrate this by feeding adversarial
images obtained from cell-phone camera to an ImageNet Inception classifier and
measuring the classification accuracy of the system. We find that a large
fraction of adversarial examples are classified incorrectly even when perceived
through the camera.}},

labelled data is hard to collect, and in some applications larger amounts of

as CNNs overfit quickly. We present an efficient Bayesian CNN, offering better
robustness to over-fitting on small data than traditional approaches. This is
by placing a probability distribution over the CNN's kernels. We approximate
our model's intractable posterior with Bernoulli variational distributions,
requiring no additional model parameters.


On the theoretical side, we cast dropout network training as approximate
inference in Bayesian neural networks. This allows us to implement our model
using existing tools in deep learning with no increase in time complexity,
while highlighting a negative result in the field. We show a considerable
improvement in classification accuracy compared to standard techniques and

reinterpret the problem of computing the log-determinant as a Bayesian

bounds from matrix theory and evidence derived from stochastic trace estimation
to obtain probabilistic estimates for the log-determinant and its associated

theoretic appeal, the performance of our proposal is competitive with
state-of-the-art approaches to approximating the log-determinant, while also

  abstract = {{A sequence of approximations for the determinant and its logarithm of a
complex matrixis derived, along with relative error bounds. The determinant
approximations are derived from expansions of det(X)=exp(trace(log(X))), and
they apply to non-Hermitian matrices. Examples illustrate that these
determinant approximations are efficient for lattice simulations of finite
temperature nuclear matter, and that they use significantly less space than
Gaussian elimination. The first approximation in the sequence is a block
diagonal approximation; it represents an extension of Fischer's and Hadamard's
inequalities to non-Hermitian matrices. In the special case of Hermitian
positive-definite matrices, block diagonal approximations can be competitive
with sparse inverse approximations. At last, a different representation of
sparse inverse approximations is given and it is shown that their accuracy
increases as more matrix elements are included.}},

  abstract = {{Variational inference is a powerful tool for approximate inference, and it
has been recently applied for representation learning with deep generative
models. We develop the variational Gaussian process (VGP), a Bayesian
nonparametric variational family, which adapts its shape to match complex
posterior distributions. The VGP generates approximate posterior samples by
generating latent inputs and warping them through random non-linear mappings;
the distribution over random mappings is learned during inference, enabling the
transformed outputs to adapt to varying complexity. We prove a universal
approximation theorem for the VGP, demonstrating its representative power for
learning any model. For inference we present a variational objective inspired
by auto-encoders and perform black box inference over a wide class of models.
The VGP achieves new state-of-the-art results for unsupervised learning,
inferring models such as the deep latent Gaussian model and the recently
proposed DRAW.}},

  abstract = {{In recent years, spectral clustering has become one of the most popular modern clustering algorithms. It is simple to implement, can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm. On the first glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really does. The goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions. We describe different graph Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several different approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral clustering algorithms are discussed.}},

@misc{Smith14,
  abstract = {The techniques and analysis presented in this paper provide new methods to
solve optimization problems posed on Riemannian manifolds. A new point of view
is offered for the solution of constrained optimization problems. Some
classical optimization techniques on Euclidean space are generalized to
Riemannian manifolds. Several algorithms are presented and their convergence
properties are analyzed employing the Riemannian structure of the manifold.
Specifically, two apparently new algorithms, which can be thought of as
Newton's method and the conjugate gradient method on Riemannian manifolds, are
presented and shown to possess, respectively, quadratic and superlinear
convergence. Examples of each method on certain Riemannian manifolds are given
with the results of numerical experiments. Rayleigh's quotient defined on the
sphere is one example. It is shown that Newton's method applied to this
function converges cubically, and that the Rayleigh quotient iteration is an
efficient approximation of Newton's method. The Riemannian version of the
conjugate gradient method applied to this function gives a new algorithm for
finding the eigenvectors corresponding to the extreme eigenvalues of a
symmetric matrix. Another example arises from extremizing the function
\$\mathop{\rm tr} {\Theta}^{\scriptscriptstyle\rm T}Q{\Theta}N\$ on the special
orthogonal group. In a similar example, it is shown that Newton's method
applied to the sum of the squares of the off-diagonal entries of a symmetric
matrix converges cubically.},

  abstract = {Minimization with orthogonality constraints (e.g., {\\$}{\\$}X^{\\backslash}top X = I{\\$}{\\$} ) and/or spherical constraints (e.g., {\\$}{\\$}{\\backslash}Vert x{\\backslash}Vert {\_}2 = 1{\\$}{\\$} ) has wide applications in polynomial optimization, combinatorial optimization, eigenvalue problems, sparse PCA, p-harmonic flows, 1-bit compressive sensing, matrix rank minimization, etc. These problems are difficult because the constraints are not only non-convex but numerically expensive to preserve during iterations. To deal with these difficulties, we apply the Cayley transform---a Crank-Nicolson-like update scheme---to preserve the constraints and based on it, develop curvilinear search algorithms with lower flops compared to those based on projections and geodesics. The efficiency of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated on a variety of test problems. In particular, for the maxcut problem, it exactly solves a decomposition formulation for the SDP relaxation. For polynomial optimization, nearest correlation matrix estimation and extreme eigenvalue problems, the proposed algorithms run very fast and return solutions no worse than those from their state-of-the-art algorithms. For the quadratic assignment problem, a gap 0.842¬†{\%} to the best known solution on the largest problem ``tai256c'' in QAPLIB can be reached in 5¬†min on a typical laptop.},

                Tumor heterogeneity is a major barrier to effective cancer diagnosis and treatment. We recently identified cancer-specific differentially DNA-methylated regions (cDMRs) in colon cancer, which also distinguish normal tissue types from each other, suggesting that these cDMRs might be generalized across cancer types. Here we show stochastic methylation variation of the same cDMRs, distinguishing cancer from normal tissue, in colon, lung, breast, thyroid and Wilms' tumors, with intermediate variation in adenomas. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing shows these variable cDMRs are related to loss of sharply delimited methylation boundaries at CpG islands. Furthermore, we find hypomethylation of discrete blocks encompassing half the genome, with extreme gene expression variability. Genes associated with the cDMRs and large blocks are involved in mitosis and matrix remodeling, respectively. We suggest a model for cancer involving loss of epigenetic stability of well-defined genomic domains that underlies increased methylation variability in cancer that may contribute to tumor heterogeneity.

  abstract = {{Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease in which unique subtypes are characterized by distinct genetic and epigenetic alterations. Here we performed comprehensive genome-scale DNA methylation profiling of 125 colorectal tumors and 29 adjacent normal tissues. We identified four DNA methylation‚Äìbased subgroups of CRC using model-based cluster analyses. Each subtype shows characteristic genetic and clinical features, indicating that they represent biologically distinct subgroups. A CIMP-high (CIMP-H) subgroup, which exhibits an exceptionally high frequency of cancer-specific DNA hypermethylation, is strongly associated with MLH1 DNA hypermethylation and the BRAFV600E mutation. A CIMP-low (CIMP-L) subgroup is enriched for KRAS mutations and characterized by DNA hypermethylation of a subset of CIMP-H-associated markers rather than a unique group of CpG islands. Non-CIMP tumors are separated into two distinct clusters. One non-CIMP subgroup is distinguished by a significantly higher frequency of TP53 mutations and frequent occurrence in the distal colon, while the tumors that belong to the fourth group exhibit a low frequency of both cancer-specific DNA hypermethylation and gene mutations and are significantly enriched for rectal tumors. Furthermore, we identified 112 genes that were down-regulated more than twofold in CIMP-H tumors together with promoter DNA hypermethylation. These represent ‚àº7\% of genes that acquired promoter DNA methylation in CIMP-H tumors. Intriguingly, 48/112 genes were also transcriptionally down-regulated in non-CIMP subgroups, but this was not attributable to promoter DNA hypermethylation. Together, we identified four distinct DNA methylation subgroups of CRC and provided novel insight regarding the role of CIMP-specific DNA hypermethylation in gene silencing.}},

  abstract = {{The estimation of finite fault earthquake source models is an inherently underdetermined problem: there is no unique solution to the inverse problem of determining the rupture history at depth as a function of time and space when our data are limited to observations at the Earth's surface. Bayesian methods allow us to determine the set of all plausible source model parameters that are consistent with the observations, our a priori assumptions about the physics of the earthquake source and wave propagation, and models for the observation errors and the errors due to the limitations in our forward model. Because our inversion approach does not require inverting any matrices other than covariance matrices, we can restrict our ensemble of solutions to only those models that are physically defensible while avoiding the need to restrict our class of models based on considerations of numerical invertibility. We only use prior information that is consistent with the physics of the problem rather than some artefice (such as smoothing) needed to produce a unique optimal model estimate. Bayesian inference can also be used to estimate model-dependent and internally consistent effective errors due to shortcomings in the forward model or data interpretation, such as poor Green's functions or extraneous signals recorded by our instruments. Until recently, Bayesian techniques have been of limited utility for earthquake source inversions because they are computationally intractable for problems with as many free parameters as typically used in kinematic finite fault models. Our algorithm, called cascading adaptive transitional metropolis in parallel (CATMIP), allows sampling of high-dimensional problems in a parallel computing framework. CATMIP combines the Metropolis algorithm with elements of simulated annealing and genetic algorithms to dynamically optimize the algorithm's efficiency as it runs. The algorithm is a generic Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler; it works independently of the model design, a priori constraints and data under consideration, and so can be used for a wide variety of scientific problems. We compare CATMIP's efficiency relative to several existing sampling algorithms and then present synthetic performance tests of finite fault earthquake rupture models computed using CATMIP.}},

  abstract = {{The assessment of earthquake forecast models for practical purposes requires more than simply checking model consistency in a statistical framework. One also needs to understand how to construct the best model for specific forecasting applications. We describe a Bayesian approach to evaluating earthquake forecasting models, and we consider related procedures for constructing ensemble forecasts. We show how evaluations based on Bayes factors, which measure the relative skill among forecasts, can be complementary to common goodness‚Äêof‚Äêfit tests used to measure the absolute consistency of forecasts with data. To construct ensemble forecasts, we consider averages across a forecast set, weighted by either posterior probabilities or inverse log‚Äêlikelihoods derived during prospective earthquake forecasting experiments. We account for model correlations by conditioning weights using the Garthwaite‚ÄìMubwandarikwa capped eigenvalue scheme. We apply these methods to the Regional Earthquake Likelihood Models (RELM) five‚Äêyear earthquake forecast experiment in California, and we discuss how this approach can be generalized to other ensemble forecasting applications. Specific applications of seismological importance include experiments being conducted within the Collaboratory for the Study of Earthquake Predictability (CSEP) and ensemble methods for operational earthquake forecasting.Online Material: Tables of likelihoods for each testing phase and code to analyze the RELM experiment.}},

@article{Feser11,
  abstract = {{An important challenge in current climate modeling is to realistically describe small-scale weather statistics, such as topographic precipitation and coastal wind patterns, or regional phenomena like polar lows. Global climate models simulate atmospheric processes with increasingly higher resolutions, but still regional climate models have a lot of advantages. They consume less computation time because of their limited simulation area and thereby allow for higher resolution both in time and space as well as for longer integration times. Regional climate models can be used for dynamical down-scaling purposes because their output data can be processed to produce higher resolved atmospheric fields, allowing the representation of small-scale processes and a more detailed description of physiographic details (such as mountain ranges, coastal zones, and details of soil properties). However, does higher resolution add value when compared to global model results? Most studies implicitly assume that dynamical downscaling leads to output fields that are superior to the driving global data, but little work has been carried out to substantiate these expectations. Here a series of articles is reviewed that evaluate the benefit of dynamical downscaling by explicitly comparing results of global and regional climate model data to the observations. These studies show that the regional climate model generally performs better for the medium spatial scales, but not always for the larger spatial scales. Regional models can add value, but only for certain variables and locations?particularly those influenced by regional specifics, such as coasts, or mesoscale dynamics, such as polar lows. Therefore, the decision of whether a regional climate model simulation is required depends crucially on the scientific question being addressed.}},

Here, we examine the results of historical and future climate model experiments from the phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) based on work presented at the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Workshop on CMIP5 Climate Model Analyses held in March 2012. Our analyses assess the ability of CMIP5 models to capture observed trends, and we also evaluate the projected future changes in extreme events over the contiguous Unites States. Consistent with the previous articles, here we focus on model-simulated historical trends and projections for temperature extremes, heavy precipitation, large-scale drivers of precipitation variability and drought, and extratropical storms. Comparing new CMIP5 model results with earlier CMIP3 simulations shows that in general CMIP5 simulations give similar patterns and magnitudes of future temperature and precipitation extremes in the United States relative to the projections from the earlier phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) models. Specifically, projections presented here show significant changes in hot and cold temperature extremes, heavy precipitation, droughts, atmospheric patterns such as the North American monsoon and the North Atlantic subtropical high that affect interannual precipitation, and in extratropical storms over the twenty-first century. Most of these trends are consistent with, although in some cases (such as heavy precipitation) underestimate, observed trends.}},

Researchers worldwide are analyzing the model output and will produce results likely to underlie the forthcoming Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Unprecedented in scale and attracting interest from all major climate modeling groups, CMIP5 includes ?long term? simulations of twentieth-century climate and projections for the twenty-first century and beyond. Conventional atmosphere?ocean global climate models and Earth system models of intermediate complexity are for the first time being joined by more recently developed Earth system models under an experiment design that allows both types of models to be compared to observations on an equal footing. Besides the longterm experiments, CMIP5 calls for an entirely new suite of ?near term? simulations focusing on recent decades and the future to year 2035. These ?decadal predictions? are initialized based on observations and will be used to explore the predictability of climate and to assess the forecast system's predictive skill. The CMIP5 experiment design also allows for participation of stand-alone atmospheric models and includes a variety of idealized experiments that will improve understanding of the range of model responses found in the more complex and realistic simulations. An exceptionally comprehensive set of model output is being collected and made freely available to researchers through an integrated but distributed data archive. For researchers unfamiliar with climate models, the limitations of the models and experiment design are described.}},

  abstract = {{Despite our detailed characterization of the human genome at the level of the primary DNA sequence, we are still far from understanding the molecular events underlying phenotypic variation. Epigenetic modifications to the DNA sequence and associated chromatin are known to regulate gene expression and, as such, are a significant contributor to phenotype. Studies of inbred mice and monozygotic twins show that variation in the epigenotype can be seen even between genetically identical individuals and that this, in some cases at least, is associated with phenotypic differences. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that the epigenome can be influenced by the environment and these changes can last a lifetime. However, we also know that epigenetic states in real-time are in continual flux and, as a result, the epigenome exhibits instability both within and across generations. We still do not understand the rules governing the establishment and maintenance of the epigenotype at any particular locus. The underlying DNA sequence itself and the sequence at unlinked loci (modifier loci) are certainly involved. Recent support for the existence of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in mammals suggests that the epigenetic state of the locus in the previous generation may also play a role. Over the next decade, many of these processes will be better understood, heralding a greater capacity for us to correlate measurable molecular marks with phenotype and providing the opportunity for improved diagnosis and presymptomatic healthcare.}},

@article{Johannes09,
  abstract = {{Loss or gain of DNA methylation can affect gene expression and is sometimes transmitted across generations. Such epigenetic alterations are thus a possible source of heritable phenotypic variation in the absence of DNA sequence change. However, attempts to assess the prevalence of stable epigenetic variation in natural and experimental populations and to quantify its impact on complex traits have been hampered by the confounding effects of DNA sequence polymorphisms. To overcome this problem as much as possible, two parents with little DNA sequence differences, but contrasting DNA methylation profiles, were used to derive a panel of epigenetic Recombinant Inbred Lines (epiRILs) in the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The epiRILs showed variation and high heritability for flowering time and plant height (‚àº30\%), as well as stable inheritance of multiple parental DNA methylation variants (epialleles) over at least eight generations. These findings provide a first rationale to identify epiallelic variants that contribute to heritable variation in complex traits using linkage or association studies. More generally, the demonstration that numerous epialleles across the genome can be stable over many generations in the absence of selection or extensive DNA sequence variation highlights the need to integrate epigenetic information into population genetics studies. DNA methylation is defined as an epigenetic modification because it can be inherited across cell division. Since variations in DNA methylation can affect gene expression and be inherited across generations, they can provide a source of heritable phenotypic variation that is not caused by changes in the DNA sequence. However, the extent to which this type of phenotypic variation occurs in natural or experimental populations is unknown, partly because of the difficulty in teasing apart the effect of DNA methylation variants (epialleles) from that of the DNA sequence variants also present in these populations. To overcome this problem, we have derived a population of epigenetic recombinant inbred lines in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, using parents with few DNA sequence differences but contrasting DNA methylation profiles. This population showed variation and a high degree of heritability for two complex traits, flowering time and plant height. Multiple parental DNA methylation differences were also found to be stably inherited over eight generations in this population. These findings reveal the potential impact of heritable DNA methylation variation on complex traits and demonstrate the importance of integrating epigenetic information in population genetics studies.}},

The group discussed the methods available to investigate epigenetic variation and epigenetic inheritance, and how to evaluate their importance for phenotypic evolution. We found that understanding the relevance of epigenetic effects in phenotypic evolution will require clearly delineating epigenetics within existing terminology and expanding research efforts into ecologically relevant circumstances across model and nonmodel organisms. In addition, a critical component of understanding epigenetics will be the development of new and current statistical approaches and expansion of quantitative and population genetic theory. Although the importance of heritable epigenetic effects on evolution is still under discussion, investigating them in the context of a multidisciplinary approach could transform the field.}},

Data analysis included group-level TBSS and individual-level SVM classification.RESULTS: At the group level, patients with PD versus Other had spatially consistent increase in FA and decrease in RD and MD in a bilateral network, predominantly in the right frontal white matter. At the individual level, SVM correctly classified patients with PD at the individual level with accuracies up to 97\%.CONCLUSIONS: Support vector machine‚Äìbased pattern recognition of DTI data provides highly accurate detection of patients with PD among those with suspected PD at an individual level, which is potentially clinically applicable. Because most suspected subjects with PD undergo brain MR imaging, already existing MR imaging data may be reused; this practice is very cost-efficient.}},

  abstract = {{A challenge in developing informative neuroimaging biomarkers for early diagnosis of Alzheimers disease is the need to identify biomarkers that are evident before the onset of clinical symptoms, and which have sufficient sensitivity and specificity on an individual patient basis. Recent literature suggests that spatial patterns of brain atrophy discriminate amongst Alzheimers disease, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitively normal (CN) older adults with high accuracy on an individual basis, thereby offering promise that subtle brain changes can be detected during prodromal Alzheimers disease stages. Here, we investigate whether these spatial patterns of brain atrophy can be detected in CN and MCI individuals and whether they are associated with cognitive decline. Images from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were used to construct a pattern classifier that recognizes spatial patterns of brain atrophy which best distinguish Alzheimers disease patients from CN on an individual person basis. This classifier was subsequently applied to longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging scans of CN and MCI participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) neuroimaging study. The degree to which Alzheimers disease-like patterns were present in CN and MCI subjects was evaluated longitudinally in relation to cognitive performance. The oldest BLSA CN individuals showed progressively increasing Alzheimers disease-like patterns of atrophy, and individuals with these patterns had reduced cognitive performance. MCI was associated with steeper longitudinal increases of Alzheimers disease-like patterns of atrophy, which separated them from CN (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve equal to 0.89). Our results suggest that imaging-based spatial patterns of brain atrophy of Alzheimers disease, evaluated with sophisticated pattern analysis and recognition methods, may be useful in discriminating among CN individuals who are likely to be stable versus those who will show cognitive decline. Future prospective studies will elucidate the temporal dynamics of spatial atrophy patterns and the emergence of clinical symptoms.}},

  abstract = {Background: Treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is likely to be most beneficial in the very early, possibly preclinical stages of degeneration. We explored the usefulness of fully automatic structural {MRI} classification methods for detecting subtle degenerative change. The availability of a definitive genetic test for Huntington disease ({HD}) provides an excellent metric for judging the performance of such methods in gene mutation carriers who are free of symptoms. Methods: Using the gray matter segment of {MRI} scans, this study explored the usefulness of a multivariate support vector machine to automatically identify presymptomatic {HD} gene mutation carriers ({PSCs}) in the absence of any a priori information. A multicenter data set of 96 {PSCs} and 95 age- and sex-matched controls was studied. The {PSC} group was subclassified into three groups based on time from predicted clinical onset, an estimate that is a function of {DNA} mutation size and age. Results: Subjects with at least a 33\% chance of developing unequivocal signs of {HD} in 5 years were correctly assigned to the {PSC} group 69\% of the time. Accuracy improved to 83\% when regions affected by the disease were selected a priori for analysis. Performance was at chance when the probability of developing symptoms in 5 years was less than 10\%. Conclusions: Presymptomatic Huntington disease gene mutation carriers close to estimated diagnostic onset were successfully separated from controls on the basis of single anatomic scans, without additional a priori information. Prior information is required to allow separation when degenerative changes are either subtle or variable. 10.1212/01.wnl.0000341768.28646.b6},

sets is computationally expensive. Both the calculation of the acceptance
probability and the creation of informed proposals usually require an iteration
through the whole data set. The recently proposed stochastic gradient Langevin
dynamics (SGLD) method circumvents this problem in three ways: it generates
proposals which are only based on a subset of the data, it skips the
accept-reject step and it uses sequences of decreasing step-sizes. In (Teh,
Thi\'ery and Vollmer, 2014), we provided the mathematical foundations for the
decreasing step size SGLD for example, by establishing a central limit theorem.
However, the step size of the SGLD and its extensions is in practice not
decreased to zero. This is the focus of the present article. We characterise
the asymptotic bias explicitly and its dependence on the step size and the
variance of the stochastic gradient. On that basis we derive a modified SGLD
which removes the bias due to the variance of the stochastic gradient up to
first order in the step size. Moreover, we are able to obtain bounds on finite
time bias and the MSE. The theory is illustrated with a Gaussian toy model for
which the bias and the MSE for the estimation of moments can be obtained
explicitly. For this toy model we study the gain of the SGLD over the standard
Euler method in the limit of data items \$N\rightarrow \infty\$.}},

\%Under appropriate Lyapunov conditions, We provide in this article a rigorous
mathematical framework for analysing this algorithm. We prove that, under
verifiable assumptions, the algorithm is consistent, satisfies a central limit
theorem (CLT) and its asymptotic bias-variance decomposition can be
characterized by an explicit functional of the step-sizes sequence
\$(\delta\_m)\_{m \geq 0}\$. We leverage this analysis to give practical
recommendations for the notoriously difficult tuning of this algorithm: it is
asymptotically optimal to use a step-size sequence of the type \$\delta\_m \asymp
m^{-1/3}\$, leading to an algorithm whose mean squared error (MSE) decreases at
rate \$\mathcal{O}(m^{-1/3})\$},

@article{Banerjee12,
  abstract = {{Gaussian processes are widely used in nonparametric regression, classification and spatiotemporal modelling, facilitated in part by a rich literature on their theoretical properties. However, one of their practical limitations is expensive computation, typically on the order of n3 where n is the number of data points, in performing the necessary matrix inversions. For large datasets, storage and processing also lead to computational bottlenecks, and numerical stability of the estimates and predicted values degrades with increasing n. Various methods have been proposed to address these problems, including predictive processes in spatial data analysis and the subset-of-regressors technique in machine learning. The idea underlying these approaches is to use a subset of the data, but this raises questions concerning sensitivity to the choice of subset and limitations in estimating fine-scale structure in regions that are not well covered by the subset. Motivated by the literature on compressive sensing, we propose an alternative approach that involves linear projection of all the data points onto a lower-dimensional subspace. We demonstrate the superiority of this approach from a theoretical perspective and through simulated and real data examples.}},

  abstract = {{Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a popular and successful general-purpose
tool for Bayesian inference. However, MCMC cannot be practically applied to
large data sets because of the prohibitive cost of evaluating every likelihood
term at every iteration. Here we present Firefly Monte Carlo (FlyMC) an
auxiliary variable MCMC algorithm that only queries the likelihoods of a
potentially small subset of the data at each iteration yet simulates from the
exact posterior distribution, in contrast to recent proposals that are
approximate even in the asymptotic limit. FlyMC is compatible with a wide
variety of modern MCMC algorithms, and only requires a lower bound on the
per-datum likelihood factors. In experiments, we find that FlyMC generates
samples from the posterior more than an order of magnitude faster than regular
MCMC, opening up MCMC methods to larger datasets than were previously
considered feasible.}},

an O(\$N^3\$) cost, iterative Krylov methods are often used with fast

iteration is slow and preconditioning becomes necessary. We investigate
preconditioning from the viewpoint of scalability and efficiency. The problems
that conventional preconditioners face when applied to kernel methods are
demonstrated. A \emph{novel flexible preconditioner }that not only improves
convergence but also allows utilization of fast kernel matrix-vector products

synthetic data, and subsequently on a suite of test problems in kernel
regression and geostatistical kriging.},

@article{Lyne14,
  abstract = {{A large number of statistical models are "doubly-intractable": the likelihood
normalising term, which is a function of the model parameters, is intractable,
as well as the marginal likelihood (model evidence). This means that standard
inference techniques to sample from the posterior, such as Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC), cannot be used. Examples include, but are not confined to,
massive Gaussian Markov random fields, autologistic models and Exponential
random graph models. A number of approximate schemes based on MCMC techniques,
Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) or analytic approximations to the
posterior have been suggested, and these are reviewed here. Exact MCMC schemes,
which can be applied to a subset of doubly-intractable distributions, have also
been developed and are described in this paper. As yet, no general method
exists which can be applied to all classes of models with doubly-intractable
posteriors. In addition, taking inspiration from the Physics literature, we
study an alternative method based on representing the intractable likelihood as
an infinite series. Unbiased estimates of the likelihood can then be obtained
by finite time stochastic truncation of the series via Russian Roulette
sampling, although the estimates are not necessarily positive. Results from the
Quantum Chromodynamics literature are exploited to allow the use of possibly
negative estimates in a pseudo-marginal MCMC scheme such that expectations with
respect to the posterior distribution are preserved. The methodology is
reviewed on well-known examples such as the parameters in Ising models, the
posterior for Fisher-Bingham distributions on the \$d\$-Sphere and a large-scale
Gaussian Markov Random Field model describing the Ozone Column data. This leads
to a critical assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the methodology
with pointers to ongoing research.}},

much cheaper to compute than others. Each of the components can be sequentially
compared with a uniform variate, the first rejection signalling that the

optimization of the variational objective where the noisy gradient is computed
from Monte Carlo samples from the variational distribution. We develop a number
of methods to reduce the variance of the gradient, always maintaining the
criterion that we want to avoid difficult model-based derivations. We evaluate
our method against the corresponding black box sampling based methods. We find
that our method reaches better predictive likelihoods much faster than sampling
methods. Finally, we demonstrate that Black Box Variational Inference lets us
easily explore a wide space of models by quickly constructing and evaluating
several models of longitudinal healthcare data.}},

  abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Support Vector Machines (SVMs) - using a variety of string kernels - have been successfully applied to biological sequence classification problems. While SVMs achieve high classification accuracy they lack interpretability. In many applications, it does not suffice that an algorithm just detects a biological signal in the sequence, but it should also provide means to interpret its solution in order to gain biological insight.RESULTS:We propose novel and efficient algorithms for solving the so-called Support Vector Multiple Kernel Learning problem. The developed techniques can be used to understand the obtained support vector decision function in order to extract biologically relevant knowledge about the sequence analysis problem at hand. We apply the proposed methods to the task of acceptor splice site prediction and to the problem of recognizing alternatively spliced exons. Our algorithms compute sparse weightings of substring locations, highlighting which parts of the sequence are important for discrimination.CONCLUSION:The proposed method is able to deal with thousands of examples while combining hundreds of kernels within reasonable time, and reliably identifies a few statistically significant positions.}},

  abstract = {{Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) can be clinically indistinguishable, especially in the early stages, despite distinct patterns of molecular pathology. Structural neuroimaging holds promise for providing objective biomarkers for discriminating these diseases at the single subject level but all studies to date have reported incomplete separation of disease groups. In this study, we employed multi-class pattern recognition to assess the value of anatomical patterns derived from a widely available structural neuroimaging sequence for automated classification of these disorders. To achieve this, 17 patients with PSP, 14 with IPD and 19 with MSA were scanned using structural MRI along with 19 healthy controls (HCs). An advanced probabilistic pattern recognition approach was employed to evaluate the diagnostic value of several pre-defined anatomical patterns for discriminating the disorders, including: (i) a subcortical motor network; (ii) each of its component regions and (iii) the whole brain. All disease groups could be discriminated simultaneously with high accuracy using the subcortical motor network. The region providing the most accurate predictions overall was the midbrain/brainstem, which discriminated all disease groups from one another and from HCs. The subcortical network also produced more accurate predictions than the whole brain and all of its constituent regions. PSP was accurately predicted from the midbrain/brainstem, cerebellum and all basal ganglia compartments; MSA from the midbrain/brainstem and cerebellum and IPD from the midbrain/brainstem only. This study demonstrates that automated analysis of structural MRI can accurately predict diagnosis in individual patients with Parkinsonian disorders, and identifies distinct patterns of regional atrophy particularly useful for this process. }},

  abstract = {{The method of tempered transitions was proposed by Neal (1996) for tackling
the difficulties arising when using Markov chain Monte Carlo to sample from
multimodal distributions. In common with methods such as simulated tempering
and Metropolis-coupled MCMC, the key idea is to utilise a series of
successively easier to sample distributions to improve movement around the
state space. Tempered transitions does this by incorporating moves through
these less modal distributions into the MCMC proposals. Unfortunately the
improved movement between modes comes at a high computational cost with a low
acceptance rate of expensive proposals. We consider how the algorithm may be
tuned to increase the acceptance rates for a given number of temperatures. We
find that the commonly assumed geometric spacing of temperatures is reasonable
in many but not all applications.}},

The algorithm constructs an independent proposal based on an approximation of the target density. The approximation is built from a set of (initial) support points - data that act as parameters for the approximation - and the predictive density of a finite multivariate Polya tree. In an initial "warming-up" phase, the support points are iteratively relocated to regions of higher support under the target distribution to minimize the distance between the target distribution and the Polya tree predictive distribution. In the "sampling" phase, samples from the final approximating mixture of finite Polya trees are used as candidates which are accepted with a standard Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probability. Several illustrations are presented, including comparisons of the proposed approach to Metropolis-within-Gibbs and delayed rejection adaptive Metropolis algorithm.}},

The main result is a weak convergence result as the dimension of a sequence of target densities, n, converges to 1. When the proposal variance is appropriately scaled according to n, the sequence of stochastic processes formed by the first component of each Markov chain, converge to the appropriate limiting Langevin diffusion process. The limiting diffusion approximation admits a straight-forward efficiency maximization problem, and the resulting asymptotically optimal policy is related to the asymptotic acceptance rate of proposed moves for the algorithm. The asymptotically optimal acceptance rate is 0.234 under quite general conditions. The main result is proved in the case where the target density has a symmetric product form. Extensions of the result are discussed.}},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters
that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by
first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to
high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods
such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is
highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size {\epsilon} and a
desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm
exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the
algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an
extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses
a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a
wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to
double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as
efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC
method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also
derive a method for adapting the step size parameter {\epsilon} on the fly
based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at
all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic
inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

  abstract = {{Summary The goal of animal breeding is to improve performance traits of animal populations through selection. The selection criterion is usually based on best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) of additive genetic effects. BLUP requires knowledge about variance components that have to be estimated in practice. Due to its desirable properties restricted maximum likelihood (REML) has become the method of choice for the estimation of variance components of mixed linear models in animal breeding. Impressive progress has been made in the development of efficient computing algorithms that allow REML to be used for general mixed linear models of large data sets. Various flexible computer programs have become available. Due to the adoption of Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures Bayesian estimation has recently become feasible and is increasingly used in animal breeding applications. The availability of powerful computers and advances in the efficiency of computing algorithms allow the consideration of increasingly complex models. Therefore, the development and application of appropriate statistical procedures for model comparison is becoming more important.

Die stetige Steigerung der Rechenleistung von Computern und die Fortschritte bei der Entwicklung effizienter Rechenalgorithmen erlauben die Anwendung immer komplexerer Modelle.

However, the construction of such models via likelihood maximization requires the solution of a difficult multi-modal optimization problem involving an expensive O(n3) factorization. The optimization techniques used to solve this problem may require many such factorizations and can result in a significant bottleneck. This article derives an adjoint formulation of the likelihood employed in the construction of a kriging model via reverse algorithmic differentiation. This adjoint is found to calculate the likelihood and all of its derivatives more efficiently than the standard analytical method and can therefore be used within a simple local search or within a hybrid global optimization to accelerate convergence and therefore reduce the cost of the likelihood optimization.}},

  abstract = {{This article introduces a new general method for genealogical inference that samples independent genealogical histories using importance sampling (IS) and then samples other parameters with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). It is then possible to more easily utilize the advantages of importance sampling in a fully Bayesian framework. The method is applied to the problem of estimating recent changes in effective population size from temporally spaced gene frequency data. The method gives the posterior distribution of effective population size at the time of the oldest sample and at the time of the most recent sample, assuming a model of exponential growth or decline during the interval. The effect of changes in number of alleles, number of loci, and sample size on the accuracy of the method is described using test simulations, and it is concluded that these have an approximately equivalent effect. The method is used on three example data sets and problems in interpreting the posterior densities are highlighted and discussed.}},

classification and regression applications, but questions remain about how the
power of these models can be safely exploited when training data is limited.
This book demonstrates how Bayesian methods allow complex neural network
models to be used without fear of the "overfitting" that can occur with
traditional training methods. Insight into the nature of these complex
Bayesian models is provided by a theoretical investigation of the priors over
functions that underlie them. A practical implementation of Bayesian neural
network learning using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is also described, and
software for it is freely available over the Internet. Presupposing only basic
knowledge of probability and statistics, this book should be of interest to
researchers in statistics, engineering, and artificial intelligence.}},

To apply the proposed method, one only needs to be able to maximize slightly modified likelihood functions and to evaluate the observed information at the maxima. Nevertheless, the resulting approximations are generally as accurate and in some cases more accurate than approximations based on third-order expansions of the likelihood and requiring the evaluation of third derivatives. The approximate marginal posterior densities behave very much like saddle-point approximations for sampling distributions. The principal regularity condition required is that the likelihood times prior be unimodal.}},

  abstract = {{Summary.‚ÄÇ The paper proposes Metropolis adjusted Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling methods defined on the Riemann manifold to resolve the shortcomings of existing Monte Carlo algorithms when sampling from target densities that may be high dimensional and exhibit strong correlations. The methods provide fully automated adaptation mechanisms that circumvent the costly pilot runs that are required to tune proposal densities for Metropolis‚ÄìHastings or indeed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithms. This allows for highly efficient sampling even in very high dimensions where different scalings may be required for the transient and stationary phases of the Markov chain. The methodology proposed exploits the Riemann geometry of the parameter space of statistical models and thus automatically adapts to the local structure when simulating paths across this manifold, providing highly efficient convergence and exploration of the target density. The performance of these Riemann manifold Monte Carlo methods is rigorously assessed by performing inference on logistic regression models, log-Gaussian Cox point processes, stochastic volatility models and Bayesian estimation of dynamic systems described by non-linear differential equations. Substantial improvements in the time-normalized effective sample size are reported when compared with alternative sampling approaches. MATLAB code that is available from http://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/research/rmhmc allows replication of all the results reported.}},

This article develops simple tests of posterior simulators that detect both kinds of errors, and uses them to detect and correct errors in two previously published articles. The tests exploit the fact that a Bayesian model specifies the joint distribution of observables (data) and unobservables (parameters). There are two joint distribution simulators. The marginal-conditional simulator draws unobservables from the prior and then observables conditional on unobservables. The successive-conditional simulator alternates between the posterior simulator and an observables simulator. Formal comparison of moment approximations of the two simulators reveals existing analytical or coding errors in the posterior simulator.}},

@article{KnorrHeld02,
  abstract = {{			Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) models are commonly used to model spatial correlation in disease mapping applications. For Bayesian inference by MCMC, so far mainly single\&\#150;site updating algorithms have been considered. However, convergence and mixing properties of such algorithms can be extremely poor due to strong dependencies of parameters in the posterior distribution. In this paper, we propose various block sampling algorithms in order to improve the MCMC performance. The methodology is rather general, allows for non\&\#150;standard full conditionals, and can be applied in a modular fashion in a large number of different scenarios. For illustration we consider three different applications: two formulations for spatial modelling of a single disease (with and without additional unstructured parameters respectively), and one formulation for the joint analysis of two diseases. The results indicate that the largest benefits are obtained if parameters and the corresponding hyperparameter are updated jointly in one large block. Implementation of such block algorithms is relatively easy using methods for fast sampling of Gaussian Markov random fields (Rue, 2001). By comparison, Monte Carlo estimates based on single\&\#150;site updating can be rather misleading, even for very long runs. Our results may have wider relevance for efficient MCMC simulation in hierarchical models with Markov random field components.}},

  abstract = {{In this article we discuss the problem of assessing the performance of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms on the basis of simulation output. In essence, we extend the original ideas of Gelman and Rubin and, more recently, Brooks and Gelman, to problems where we are able to split the variation inherent within the MCMC simulation output into two distinct groups. We show how such a diagnostic may be useful in assessing the performance of MCMC samplers addressing model choice problems, such as the reversible jump MCMC algorithm. In the model choice context, we show how the reversible jump MCMC simulation output for parameters that retain a coherent interpretation throughout the simulation, can be used to assess convergence. By considering various decompositions of the sampling variance of this parameter, we can assess the performance of our MCMC sampler in terms of its mixing properties both within and between models and we illustrate our approach in both the graphical Gaussian models and normal mixtures context. Finally, we provide an example of the application of our diagnostic to the assessment of the influence of different starting values on MCMC simulation output, thereby illustrating the wider utility of our method beyond the Bayesian model choice and reversible jump MCMC context.}},

A good choice of the proposal distribution is crucial for the rapid convergence of the Metropolis algorithm. In this paper, given a family of parametric Markovian kernels, we develop an algorithm for optimizing the kernel by maximizing the expected squared jumped distance, an objective function that characterizes the Markov chain under its d-dimensional stationary distribution. The algorithm uses the information accumulated by a single path and adapts the choice of the parametric kernel in the direction of the local maximum of the objective function using multiple importance sampling techniques. We follow a two-stage approach: a series of adaptive optimization steps followed by an MCMC run with fixed kernel. It is not necessary for the adaptation itself to converge. Using several examples, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, even for cases in which the Metropolis transition kernel is initialized at very poor values.}},

The focus is on two methods of marginal likelihood estimation. First, a statistical failure of the widely employed Posterior Harmonic Mean estimator is highlighted. It is demonstrated that there is a systematic bias capable of significantly skewing Bayes factor estimates, which has not previously been highlighted in the literature. Second, a detailed study of the recently proposed Thermodynamic Integral estimator is presented, which characterises the error associated with its discrete form. An experimental study using analytically tractable linear regression models highlights substantial differences with recently published results regarding optimal discretisation. Finally, with the insights gained, it is demonstrated how Population MCMC and thermodynamic integration methods may be elegantly combined to estimate Bayes factors accurately enough to discriminate between nonlinear models based on systems of ODEs, which has important application in describing the behaviour of complex processes arising in a wide variety of research areas, such as Systems Biology, Computational Ecology and Chemical Engineering.}},

@article{Kass95,
  abstract = {{In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of probability, Jeffresy developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpies was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: From Jeffrey's Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. In "non-Bayesian significance tests. The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.}},

The size of the data set, \&quot;n\&quot;, causes problems in computing optimal spatial predictors such as kriging, since its computational cost is of order <formula format=\&quot;inline\&quot;><file name=\&quot;rssb\_633\_mu1.gif\&quot; type=\&quot;gif\&quot; /></formula>. In addition, a large data set is often defined on a large spatial domain, so the spatial process of interest typically exhibits non-stationary behaviour over that domain. A flexible family of non-stationary covariance functions is defined by using a set of basis functions that is fixed in number, which leads to a spatial prediction method that we call fixed rank kriging. Specifically, fixed rank kriging is kriging within this class of non-stationary covariance functions. It relies on computational simplifications when \&quot;n\&quot; is very large, for obtaining the spatial best linear unbiased predictor and its mean-squared prediction error for a hidden spatial process. A method based on minimizing a weighted Frobenius norm yields best estimators of the covariance function parameters, which are then substituted into the fixed rank kriging equations. The new methodology is applied to a very large data set of total column ozone data, observed over the entire globe, where \&quot;n\&quot; is of the order of hundreds of thousands.

The results are as follows: First, we provide additional support for the claim that the degree of democracy has an independent positive effect on air quality. Second, we find that among democracies, presidential systems are more conducive to air quality than parliamentary ones. Third, in testing competing claims about the effect of interest groups on public goods provision in democracies we establish that labor union strength contributes to lower environmental quality, whereas the strength of green parties has the opposite effect.}},

Asymptotically, the variance is less than that obtained using simple random sampling, with the degree of variance reduction depending on the degree of additivity in the function being integrated.

@article{Izenman91,
  abstract = {{Advances in computation and the fast and cheap computational facilities now available to statisticians have had a significant impact upon statistical research, and especially the development of nonparametric data analysis procedures. In particular, theoretical and applied research on nonparametric density estimation has had a noticeable influence on related topics, such as nonparametric regression, nonparametric discrimination, and nonparametric pattern recognition. This article reviews recent developments in nonparametric density estimation and includes topics that have been omitted from review articles and books on the subject. The early density estimation methods, such as the histogram, kernel estimators, and orthogonal series estimators are still very popular, and recent research on them is described. Different types of restricted maximum likelihood density estimators, including order-restricted estimators, maximum penalized likelihood estimators, and sieve estimators, are discussed, where restrictions are imposed upon the class of densities or on the form of the likelihood function. Nonparametric density estimators that are data-adaptive and lead to locally smoothed estimators are also discussed; these include variable partition histograms, estimators based on statistically equivalent blocks, nearest-neighbor estimators, variable kernel estimators, and adaptive kernel estimators. For the multivariate case, extensions of methods of univariate density estimation are usually straightforward but can be computationally expensive. A method of multivariate density estimation that did not spring from a univariate generalization is described, namely, projection pursuit density estimation, in which both dimensionality reduction and density estimation can be pursued at the same time. Finally, some areas of related research are mentioned, such as nonparametric estimation of functionals of a density, robust parametric estimation, semiparametric models, and density estimation for censored and incomplete data, directional and spherical data, and density estimation for dependent sequences of observations.}},

Hastings (1970) outlined a general procedure for constructing and simulating such a Markov chain. The matrix P of transition probabilities is constructed using a defined symmetric function sij and an arbitrary transition matrix Q. Here, for a given Q, the relative merits of the two simple choices for sij suggested by Hastings (1970) are discussed. The optimum choice for sij is shown to be one of these. For the other choice, those Q are given which are known to make the sampling method based on P asymptotically less precise than independent sampling. 10.1093/biomet/60.3.607},

  abstract = {{Likelihood-based cross-validation is a statistical tool for selecting a density estimate based on n i.i.d. observations from the true density among a collection of candidate density estimators. General examples are the selection of a model indexing a maximum likelihood estimator, and the selection of a bandwidth indexing a nonparametric (e.g. kernel) density estimator. In this article, we establish a finite sample result for a general class of likelihood-based cross-validation procedures (as indexed by the type of sample splitting used, e.g. V-fold cross-validation). This result implies that the cross-validation selector performs asymptotically as well (w.r.t. to the Kullback-Leibler distance to the true density) as a benchmark model selector which is optimal for each given dataset and depends on the true density. Crucial conditions of our theorem are that the size of the validation sample converges to infinity, which excludes leave-one-out cross-validation, and that the candidate density estimates are bounded away from zero and infinity. We illustrate these asymptotic results and the practical performance of likelihood-based cross-validation for the purpose of bandwidth selection with a simulation study. Moreover, we use likelihood-based cross-validation in the context of regulatory motif detection in DNA sequences.}},

Two inherent problems in density estimation for lifetime data are the <i>spill-over</i> at the origin and the smoothing parameter selection. To address these issues, we propose the use of asymmetric kernels (like inverse Gaussian) with bandwidths selected by a Bayes criterion. We show strong pointwise consistency of the density estimator, and for suitable choices of the prior, we show that one can obtain meaningful bandwidths with the same rates of convergence as for the classical asymptotically optimal bandwidths.}},

A Monte Carlo study shows that under the average squared error criterion, the Bayesian bandwidth selector is comparable to the cross-validation method and clearly outperforms the bootstrapping and rule-of-thumb bandwidth selectors. The Bayesian bandwidth selector is applied to a multivariate kernel regression model that is often used to estimate the state-price density of Arrow-Debreu securities with the S\&P 500 index options data and the DAX index options data. The proposed Bayesian bandwidth selector represents a data-driven solution to the problem of choosing bandwidths for the multivariate kernel regression involved in the nonparametric estimation of the state-price density pioneered by A\"{i}t-Sahalia and Lo [A\"{i}t-Sahalia, Y., Lo, A.W., 1998.

@article{Gelman92,
  abstract = {{The Gibbs sampler, the algorithm of Metropolis and similar iterative simulation methods are potentially very helpful for summarizing multivariate distributions. Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.}},

In recent years, a great variety of such applications have been described in the literature. Applied statisticians who are new to these methods may have several questions and concerns, however: How much effort and expertise are needed to design and use a Markov chain sampler? How much confidence can one have in the answers that MCMC produces? How does the use of MCMC affect the rest of the model-building process? At the Joint Statistical Meetings in August, 1996, a panel of experienced MCMC users discussed these and other issues, as well as various "tricks of the trade". This article is an edited recreation of that discussion. Its purpose is to offer advice and guidance to novice users of MCMC-and to not-so-novice users as well. Topics include building confidence in simulation results, methods for speeding and assessing convergence, estimating standard errors, identification of models for which good MCMC algorithms exist, and the current state of software development.}},

  abstract = {{The history of the development of statistical hypothesis testing in time series analysis is reviewed briefly and it is pointed out that the hypothesis testing procedure is not adequately defined as the procedure for statistical model identification. The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.}},

  abstract = {{Non-parametric time‚Äìfrequency techniques are increasingly developed and employed to process non-stationary vibration signals of rotating machinery in a great deal of condition monitoring literature. However, their capacity to reveal power variations in the time‚Äìfrequency space as precisely as possible becomes a hard constraint when the aim is that of monitoring the occurrence of mechanical faults. Therefore, for an early diagnosis, it is imperative to utilize methods with high temporal resolution, aiming at detecting spectral variations occurring in a very short time. This paper proposes three new adaptive parametric models transformed from time-varying vector-autoregressive model with their parameters estimated by means of noise-adaptive Kalman filter, extended Kalman filter and modified extended Kalman filter, respectively, on the basis of different assumptions. The performance analysis of the proposed adaptive parametric models is demonstrated using numerically generated non-stationary test signals. The results suggest that the proposed models possess appealing advantages in processing non-stationary signals and thus are able to provide reliable time‚Äìfrequency domain information for condition monitoring.}},

  abstract = {{Time-series novelty detection, or anomaly detection, refers to the automatic identification of novel or abnormal events embedded in normal time-series points. Although it is a challenging topic in data mining, it has been acquiring increasing attention due to its huge potential for immediate applications. In this paper, a new algorithm for time-series novelty detection based on one-class support vector machines (SVMs) is proposed. The concepts of phase and projected phase spaces are first introduced, which allows us to convert a time-series into a set of vectors in the (projected) phase spaces. Then we interpret novel events in time-series as outliers of the "normal" distribution of the converted vectors in the (projected) phase spaces. One-class SVMs are employed as the outlier detectors. In order to obtain robust detection results, a technique to combine intermediate results at different phase spaces is also proposed. Experiments on both synthetic and measured data are presented to demonstrate the promising performance of the new algorithm.}},

The KL divergence between two Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) is frequently needed in the fields of speech and image recognition. Unfortunately the KL divergence between two GMMs is not analytically tractable, nor does any efficient computational algorithm exist. Some techniques cope with this problem by replacing the KL divergence with other functions that can be computed efficiently. We introduce two new methods, the variational approximation and the variational upper bound, and compare them to existing methods. We discuss seven different techniques in total and weigh the benefits of each one against the others. To conclude we evaluate the performance of each one through numerical experiments}},

  abstract = {{Although there has been a surge of interest in density estimation in recent years, much of the published research has been concerned with purely technical matters with insufficient emphasis given to the technique's practical value. Furthermore, the subject has been rather inaccessible to the general statistician.The account presented in this book places emphasis on topics of methodological importance, in the hope that this will facilitate broader practical application of density estimation and also encourage research into relevant theoretical work. The book also provides an introduction to the subject for those with general interests in statistics. The important role of density estimation as a graphical technique is reflected by the inclusion of more than 50 graphs and figures throughout the text.Several contexts in which density estimation can be used are discussed, including the exploration and presentation of data, nonparametric discriminant analysis, cluster analysis, simulation and the bootstrap, bump hunting, projection pursuit, and the estimation of hazard rates and other quantities that depend on the density. This book includes general survey of methods available for density estimation. The Kernel method, both for univariate and multivariate data, is discussed in detail, with particular emphasis on ways of deciding how much to smooth and on computation aspects. Attention is also given to adaptive methods, which smooth to a greater degree in the tails of the distribution, and to methods based on the idea of penalized likelihood.}},

  abstract = {{Breast cancer is the major cause of death amongst women in the 35 to 55 age group. Mammography is the only feasible imaging modality for screening large numbers of women. With the present screening policy, there are three million mammograms to be analysed each year in the UK; there is therefore a need (as yet unmet) for an automated analysis system which could highlight areas of interest. In the first instance, the areas of interest might simply be any mass-like structures and this is indeed the approach reported on in this paper. Mammography is typical of many problems in medicine: the class of real interest is under-represented in the database of available examples and hence its prior probability will be very low. As a result of this, there are very few examples of abnormalities in any of the existing databases. If a neural network classifier is trained using the standard approach of minimising the mean-squared error (MSE) at the output, the under-represented class will be ignored. We have been exploring an alternative approach in which we attempt to learn a description of normality using the large number of available mammograms which do not show any evidence of mass-like structures. The idea is then to test for novelty against this description in order to try and identify candidate masses in previously unseen images analysis and interpretation and present a sample of the results which we have so far obtained on a standard database}},

We also incorporate a geodesic kernel into the soft kernel k-means, in order to take the data manifold structure into account. The method is referred to as soft geodesic kernel k-means. In contrast to k-means, our method is able to identify clusters that are not linearly separable. In addition, soft responsibilities as well as geodesic kernel, improve the clustering performance, compared to kernel k-means. Numerical experiments with toy data sets and real-world data sets (UCI and document clustering), confirm the useful behavior of the proposed method}},

@book{Bishop06,
  abstract = {{The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. The author's previous textbook "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted.}},

@book{MacKay03,
  abstract = {{Information theory and inference, often taught separately, are here united in
one entertaining textbook. These topics lie at the heart of many exciting
areas of contemporary science and engineering - communication, signal
processing, data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, computational
neuroscience, bioinformatics, and cryptography. This textbook introduces
theory in tandem with applications. Information theory is taught alongside
practical communication systems, such as arithmetic coding for data
compression and sparse-graph codes for error-correction. A toolbox of
inference techniques, including message-passing algorithms, Monte Carlo
methods, and variational approximations, are developed alongside applications
of these tools to clustering, convolutional codes, independent component
analysis, and neural networks. The final part of the book describes the state
of the art in error-correcting codes, including low-density parity-check
codes, turbo codes, and digital fountain codes -- the twenty-first century
standards for satellite communications, disk drives, and data broadcast.
Richly illustrated, filled with worked examples and over 400 exercises, some
with detailed solutions, David MacKay's groundbreaking book is ideal for self-
learning and for undergraduate or graduate courses. Interludes on crosswords,
evolution, and sex provide entertainment along the way. In sum, this is a
textbook on information, communication, and coding for a new generation of
students, and an unparalleled entry point into these subjects for
professionals in areas as diverse as computational biology, financial
engineering, and machine learning.}},

The objective functions are based on selecting c representative objects (medoids) from the data set in such a way that the total fuzzy dissimilarity within each cluster is minimized. A comparison of FCMdd with the well-known relational fuzzy c-means algorithm (RFCM) shows that FCMdd is more efficient. We present several applications of these algorithms to Web mining, including Web document clustering, snippet clustering, and Web access log analysis}},

Our investigation includes probabilistic and (a slightly modified implementation of) possibilistic memberships, which will be discussed under a unified view. We give a convergence proof for the axis-parallel variant of the algorithm by Gustafson and Kessel, that can be generalized to other algorithms more easily than in the usual approach. Using reformulated fuzzy clustering algorithms, we apply Banach's classical contraction principle and establish a relationship between saddle points and attractive fixed points. For the special case of FCM we derive a sufficient condition for fixed points to be attractive, allowing identification of them as (local) minima of the objective function (excluding the possibility of a saddle point).}},

We consider the problem of constructing a representation for data lying on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in a high-dimensional space. Drawing on the correspondence between the graph Laplacian, the Laplace Beltrami operator on the manifold, and the connections to the heat equation, we propose a geometrically motivated algorithm for representing the high-dimensional data. The algorithm provides a computationally efficient approach to nonlinear dimensionality reduction that has locality-preserving properties and a natural connection to clustering. Some potential applications and illustrative examples are discussed.}},

  abstract = {{Many areas of science depend on exploratory data analysis and visualization. The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.}},

There are works addressing the unification of the two schemes. Here, we focus on providing a model for the transition from one schema to the other, to exploit the dual information given by the two schemes, and to add flexibility for the interpretation of results. We apply an uncertainty model based on interval values to memberships in the clustering framework, obtaining a framework that we term graded possibility. We outline a basic example of graded possibilistic clustering algorithm and add some practical remarks about its implementation. The experimental demonstrations presented highlight the different properties attainable through appropriate implementation of a suitable graded possibilistic model. An interesting application is found in automated segmentation of diagnostic medical images, where the model provides an interactive visualization tool for this task.}},

@article{Kluger03,
  abstract = {{
                Global analyses of RNA expression levels are useful for classifying genes and overall phenotypes. Often these classification problems are linked, and one wants to find "marker genes" that are differentially expressed in particular sets of "conditions." We have developed a method that simultaneously clusters genes and conditions, finding distinctive "checkerboard" patterns in matrices of gene expression data, if they exist. In a cancer context, these checkerboards correspond to genes that are markedly up- or downregulated in patients with particular types of tumors. Our method, spectral biclustering, is based on the observation that checkerboard structures in matrices of expression data can be found in eigenvectors corresponding to characteristic expression patterns across genes or conditions. In addition, these eigenvectors can be readily identified by commonly used linear algebra approaches, in particular the singular value decomposition (SVD), coupled with closely integrated normalization steps. We present a number of variants of the approach, depending on whether the normalization over genes and conditions is done independently or in a coupled fashion. We then apply spectral biclustering to a selection of publicly available cancer expression data sets, and examine the degree to which the approach is able to identify checkerboard structures. Furthermore, we compare the performance of our biclustering methods against a number of reasonable benchmarks (e.g., direct application of SVD or normalized cuts to raw data).

@book{Bishop95,
  abstract = {{This book provides a solid statistical foundation for neural networks from a pattern recognition perspective. The focus is on the types of neural nets that are most widely used in practical applications, such as the multi-layer perceptron and radial basis function networks. Rather than trying to cover many different types of neural networks, Bishop thoroughly covers topics such as density estimation, error functions, parameter optimization algorithms, data pre-processing, and Bayesian methods. All topics are organized well and all mathematical foundations are explained before being applied to neural networks. The text is suitable for a graduate or advanced undergraduate level course on neural networks or for practitioners interested in applying neural networks to real-world problems. The reader is assumed to have the level of math knowledge necessary for an undergraduate science degree. This is the first comprehensive treatment of feed-forward neural networks from the perspective of statistical pattern recognition. After introducing the basic concepts, the book examines techniques for modelling probability density functions and the properties and merits of the multi-layer perceptron and radial basis function network models. Also covered are various forms of error functions, principal algorithms for error function minimalization, learning and generalization in neural networks, and Bayesian techniques and their applications. Designed as a text, with over 100 exercises, this fully up-to-date work will benefit anyone involved in the fields of neural computation and pattern recognition.}},

@article{Weston05,
  abstract = {{MOTIVATION: Building an accurate protein classification system depends critically upon choosing a good representation of the input sequences of amino acids. Recent work using string kernels for protein data has achieved state-of-the-art classification performance. However, such representations are based only on labeled data--examples with known 3D structures, organized into structural classes--whereas in practice, unlabeled data are far more plentiful. RESULTS: In this work, we develop simple and scalable cluster kernel techniques for incorporating unlabeled data into the representation of protein sequences. We show that our methods greatly improve the classification performance of string kernels and outperform standard approaches for using unlabeled data, such as adding close homologs of the positive examples to the training data. We achieve equal or superior performance to previously presented cluster kernel methods and at the same time achieving far greater computational efficiency.

In this paper, we present a kernel-based fuzzy clustering algorithm that exploits the spatial contextual information in image data. The algorithm is realized by modifying the objective function in the conventional fuzzy c-means algorithm using a kernel-induced distance metric and a spatial penalty term that takes into account the influence of the neighboring pixels on the centre pixel. Experimental results on both synthetic and real MR images show that the proposed algorithm is more robust to noise than the conventional fuzzy image segmentation algorithms.}},

For instance, it has been shown that mRNA data from 118 genes, measured at several time points in the developing hindbrain of mice, can be hierarchically clustered into various patterns (or 'waves') whose members tend to participate in common processes5. We have previously shown that hierarchical clustering can group together genes whose cis-regulatory elements are bound by the same proteins in vivo6. Hierarchical clustering has also been used to organize genes into hierarchical dendograms on the basis of their expression across multiple growth conditions7. The application of Fourier analysis to synchronized yeast mRNA expression data has identified cell-cycle periodic genes, many of which have expected cis-regulatory elements8. Here we apply a systematic set of statistical algorithms, based on whole-genome mRNA data, partitional clustering and motif discovery, to identify transcriptional regulatory sub-networks in yeast?without any a priori knowledge of their structure or any assumptions about their dynamics. This approach uncovered new regulons (sets of co-regulated genes) and their putative cis-regulatory elements. We used statistical characterization of known regulons and motifs to derive criteria by which we infer the biological significance of newly discovered regulons and motifs. Our approach holds promise for the rapid elucidation of genetic network architecture in sequenced organisms in which little biology is known.}},

  abstract = {{Many clustering models define good clusters as extrema of objective functions. Optimization of these models is often done using an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm driven by necessary conditions for local extrema. We abandon the objective function model in favor of a generalized model called alternating cluster estimation (ACE). ACE uses an alternating iteration architecture, but membership and prototype functions are selected directly by the user. Virtually every clustering model can be realized as an instance of ACE. Out of a large variety of possible instances of non-AO models, we present two examples: 1) an algorithm with a dynamically changing prototype function that extracts representative data and 2) a computationally efficient algorithm with hyperconic membership functions that allows easy extraction of membership functions. We illustrate these non-AO instances on three problems: a) simple clustering of plane data where we show that creating an unmatched ACE algorithm overcomes some problems of fuzzy c-means (FCM-AO) and possibilistic c-means (PCM-AO); b) functional approximation by clustering on a simple artificial data set; and c) functional approximation on a 12 input 1 output real world data set. ACE models work pretty well in all three cases}},

Ben-Hur et al., 2001) proposed to employ them for cluster analysis too. The basis of this support vector clustering (SVC) is density estimation through SVM training. SVC is a boundary-based clustering method, where the support information is used to construct cluster boundaries. Despite its ability to deal with outliers, to handle high dimensional data and arbitrary boundaries in data space, there are two problems in the process of cluster labelling. The first problem is its low efficiency when the number of free support vectors increases. The other problem is that it sometimes produces false negatives. We propose a robust cluster assignment method that harvests clustering results efficiently. Our method uses proximity graphs to model the proximity structure of the data. We experimentally analyze and illustrate the performance of this new approach.}},

This generalized model is called multiple spheres support vector clustering, which essentially identifies dense regions in the original space by finding their corresponding spheres with minimal radius in the feature space. A multisphere clustering algorithm based on adaptive cluster cell growing method is developed, whereby it is possible to obtain the grade of memberships, as well as cluster prototypes in partition. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated for the problem of arbitrary cluster shapes and for prototype identification in an actual application to a handwritten digit data set.}},

@book{Bollobas98,
  abstract = {{The time has now come when graph theory should be part of the education of every serious student of mathematics and computer science, both for its own sake and to enhance the appreciation of mathematics as a whole. This book is an in-depth account of graph theory, written with such a student in mind; it reflects the current state of the subject and emphasizes connections with other branches of pure mathematics. The volume grew out of the author's earlier book, Graph Theory -- An Introductory Course, but its length is well over twice that of its predecessor, allowing it to reveal many exciting new developments in the subject. Recognizing that graph theory is one of several courses competing for the attention of a student, the book contains extensive descriptive passages designed to convey the flavor of the subject and to arouse interest. In addition to a modern treatment of the classical areas of graph theory such as coloring, matching, extremal theory, and algebraic graph theory, the book presents a detailed account of newer topics, including Szemer\'{e}di's Regularity Lemma and its use, Shelah's extension of the Hales-Jewett Theorem, the precise nature of the phase transition in a random graph process, the connection between electrical networks and random walks on graphs, and the Tutte polynomial and its cousins in knot theory. In no other branch of mathematics is it as vital to tackle and solve challenging exercises in order to master the subject. To this end, the book contains an unusually large number of well thought-out exercises: over 600 in total. Although some are straightforward, most of them are substantial, and others will stretch even the most able reader.}},

@article{Chen04,
  abstract = {{Fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) with spatial constraints (FCM/spl I.bar/S) is an effective algorithm suitable for image segmentation. Its effectiveness contributes not only to the introduction of fuzziness for belongingness of each pixel but also to exploitation of spatial contextual information. Although the contextual information can raise its insensitivity to noise to some extent, FCM/spl I.bar/S still lacks enough robustness to noise and outliers and is not suitable for revealing non-Euclidean structure of the input data due to the use of Euclidean distance (L/sub 2/ norm). In this paper, to overcome the above problems, we first propose two variants, FCM/spl I.bar/S/sub 1/ and FCM/spl I.bar/S/sub 2/, of FCM/spl I.bar/S to aim at simplifying its computation and then extend them, including FCM/spl I.bar/S, to corresponding robust kernelized versions KFCM/spl I.bar/S, KFCM/spl I.bar/S/sub 1/ and KFCM/spl I.bar/S/sub 2/ by the kernel methods. Our main motives of using the kernel methods consist in: inducing a class of robust non-Euclidean distance measures for the original data space to derive new objective functions and thus clustering the non-Euclidean structures in data; enhancing robustness of the original clustering algorithms to noise and outliers, and still retaining computational simplicity. The experiments on the artificial and real-world datasets show that our proposed algorithms, especially with spatial constraints, are more effective.}},

Despite significant research, these methods have remained only loosely related. In this paper, we give an explicit theoretical connection between them. We show the generality of the weighted kernel k-means objective function, and derive the spectral clustering objective of normalized cut as a special case. Given a positive definite similarity matrix, our results lead to a novel weighted kernel k-means algorithm that monotonically decreases the normalized cut. This has important implications: a) eigenvector-based algorithms, which can be computationally prohibitive, are not essential for minimizing normalized cuts, b) various techniques, such as local search and acceleration schemes, may be used to improve the quality as well as speed of kernel k-means. Finally, we present results on several interesting data sets, including diametrical clustering of large gene-expression matrices and a handwriting recognition data set.}},

In this paper, we present a kernel method for clustering inspired by the classical K-Means algorithm in which each cluster is iteratively refined using a one-class Support Vector Machine. Our method, which can be easily implemented, compares favorably with respect to popular clustering algorithms, like K-Means, Neural Gas, and Self-Organizing Maps, on a synthetic data set and three UCI real data benchmarks (IRIS data, Wisconsin breast cancer database, Spam database).}},

@article{Ghil02,
  abstract = {{The analysis of univariate or multivariate time series provides crucial information to describe, understand, and predict climatic variability. The discovery and implementation of a number of novel methods for extracting useful information from time series has recently revitalized this classical field of study. Considerable progress has also been made in interpreting the information so obtained in terms of dynamical systems theory. In this review we describe the connections between time series analysis and nonlinear dynamics, discuss signal-to-noise enhancement, and present some of the novel methods for spectral analysis. The various steps, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of these methods, are illustrated by their application to an important climatic time series, the Southern Oscillation Index. This index captures major features of interannual climate variability and is used extensively in its prediction. Regional and global sea surface temperature data sets are used to illustrate multivariate spectral methods. Open questions and further prospects conclude the review.}},
